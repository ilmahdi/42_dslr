# DSLR Project Structure

This document describes the directory layout and the purpose of each file in the `dslr` project (DataScience x Logistic Regression).

---

## 📁 Root Directory (`dslr/`)

This is the main project folder. It contains all code, data, outputs, and documentation required to complete the DSLR project.

---

## 📁 `data/`

This directory contains the CSV datasets used in the project.

- `dataset_train.csv` — The dataset used for training and exploring the data.
- `dataset_test.csv` — The dataset used for testing predictions with the trained model.

---

## 📁 `scripts/`

All Python scripts for the core functionality of the project.

- `describe.py` — Calculates statistical summaries (count, mean, std, min, max, quartiles) of each numerical feature **without using libraries like Pandas**.
- `histogram.py` — Plots histograms to analyze the distribution of course scores across Hogwarts houses.
- `scatter_plot.py` — Generates scatter plots to visually compare two features and analyze their relationship.
- `pair_plot.py` — Displays a matrix of scatter plots (pairwise comparisons) to identify useful features for logistic regression.
- `logreg_train.py` — Implements logistic regression training using **gradient descent** (one-vs-all classification). It saves model weights.
- `logreg_predict.py` — Loads trained weights and predicts Hogwarts house for each student in the test set. Outputs `houses.csv`.

---

## 📁 `weights/`

This directory contains the trained model parameters.

- `weights.npy` — Numpy file storing logistic regression weights after training (`logreg_train.py` writes this file; `logreg_predict.py` uses it).

---

## 📁 `notebooks/`

Jupyter notebooks for optional manual exploration, testing, and debugging.

- `exploration.ipynb` — An optional interactive notebook to help explore the dataset or test functions in a sandboxed environment.

---

## 📄 `houses.csv`

The final output file generated by `logreg_predict.py`. It contains predictions in the format:

Index,Hogwarts House
0,Gryffindor
1,Hufflepuff
2,Ravenclaw


This file is used to evaluate the performance of your classifier.

---

## 📄 `requirements.txt`

Lists the Python packages required to run the project.

Example contents:

numpy
matplotlib
seaborn


Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
